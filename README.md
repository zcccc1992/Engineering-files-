Thank you for visiting this link. We provide the engineering files of our system design. 

Please click the attached files sequentially, and then click the "Download file" button in the upper right corner of the page to initiate the download (You may encounter garbled code during the process, but this will not affect the file integrity.) 

Currently, the control program for the gateway has been uploaded. We will gradually upload the remaining files in subsequent updates. 

Additionally, all documents are anonymized for the reviewers at this stage, and we commit to excluding any information that could identify the authors. 

After the paper is published online, we will switch to the public link.
